# DataPipelines
ML Series Day 1: Deep dive on how to explore your datasets for use in ML and AI applications. 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this first installment of machine learning projects I will cover the basics of working with Pandas to process data into a dataframe. 

<h2>Cleaning Datasets</h2>
This project will cover best practices on cleaning datasets for use in machine learning algorithms. 

<h2>Handling Missing Values</h2>
We will also be covering how to process missing values within datasets. 

<h2>Dataframe Manipulation</h2>
An important skillset is knowing how to manipulate a pandas dataframe. This tutorial will cover popular methods and techniques for doing so. 

<h2>Creating subsets of dataframes</h2>
Sometimes you will want to work on a subset of a larger dataset. This section covers best practices on how to do so. 

<h2>Follow for More</h2>
Follow along as we explore ML with code.
